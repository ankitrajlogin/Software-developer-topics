# 🧠 Complete Notes: TCP Handshake, HTTP, and WebSocket Explained (Interview Perspective)

## 📘 Overview
This document explains how **normal HTTPS requests** work internally, what the **TCP 3-way handshake** is, and how **WebSockets** (used in Socket.IO) differ. It’s written from an interview perspective — with all key details that help you answer both theoretical and practical questions.

---

## 🌍 1️⃣ How Normal HTTPS Request Works Internally

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **DNS Resolution**
   - The browser resolves the domain (e.g., `api.example.com`) to an IP address.
   - Example: `api.example.com → 142.251.42.14`

2. **TCP 3-Way Handshake (connection setup)**
   - Before any data is sent, the browser and server establish a reliable TCP connection.
   - Steps:
     - **SYN:** Client → Server (Request to start connection)
     - **SYN-ACK:** Server → Client (Acknowledges + sends its own sequence number)
     - **ACK:** Client → Server (Final acknowledgment)
   - Once this is done, both parties can safely send data.

3. **TLS Handshake (for HTTPS only)**
   - Adds encryption and authentication on top of TCP.
   - Involves:
     - Certificate exchange
     - Session key generation
     - Encrypted communication setup

4. **HTTP Request**
   - The client sends a request like:
     ```http
     GET /users HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     Accept: application/json
     ```

5. **Server Response**
   - The server processes the request and sends back:
     ```http
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json

     [{ "id": 1, "name": "Ankit" }]
     ```

6. **Connection Termination**
   - Once the response is received, the connection is **closed** (in HTTP/1.1).
   - Future requests require a **new TCP + TLS handshake** (unless HTTP Keep-Alive is used).

### 🔁 Flow Summary

```
Client → Request → Server → Response → Connection Ends
```

➡️ The server **cannot** send data to the client unless the client asks for it.

### ❌ Problem with HTTP
- One-directional communication (client → server)
- No real-time updates
- Requires polling (`setInterval(fetch)`), which wastes resources

---

## ⚡ 2️⃣ WebSocket (Socket.IO) — Persistent Two-Way Communication

### Step-by-Step Working

1. **Initial HTTP Handshake**
   - Client requests to “upgrade” from HTTP to WebSocket:
     ```http
     GET /socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=websocket
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     ```

2. **Protocol Upgrade**
   - Server replies:
     ```http
     HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
     Upgrade: websocket
     Connection: Upgrade
     ```
   - Now the same TCP connection is **kept open**.

3. **Persistent Connection Established**
   - Both client and server can send data anytime using the same TCP channel.

   Example:
   ```js
   // Client
   socket.emit("sendMessage", "Hi there!");

   // Server
   io.on("connection", (socket) => {
     socket.on("sendMessage", (msg) => {
       console.log(msg);
       socket.emit("reply", "Hey client, got your message!");
     });
   });
   ```

4. **Connection Remains Alive**
   - The channel remains open until the user closes the browser tab or the server disconnects.

### 🔁 WebSocket Flow Summary

```
Client ↔ Server (Two-way, continuous communication)
```

- No repeated handshakes
- No re-requests
- Data instantly flows both ways

## 🧱 3️⃣ Key Differences — HTTP vs WebSocket

| Feature | HTTP / HTTPS | WebSocket / Socket.IO |
|----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Connection Type | Short-lived (request/response) | Long-lived (persistent) |
| Communication Direction | Client → Server | Client ↔ Server |
| Protocol | HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 | WS / WSS (WebSocket Secure) |
| Underlying Transport | TCP | TCP (same as HTTP) |
| Real-time Updates | ❌ Requires polling | ✅ Instant updates |
| Overhead | High (headers each time) | Low (binary frames) |
| Server Push | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Supported |
| Use Cases | REST APIs, static content | Chat apps, live dashboards, games |

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ How the Backend Knows Where to Send Data

- Each connected client gets a **unique Socket ID** (`socket.id`).
- When the client connects:
  ```js
  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log("Connected:", socket.id);
    activeUsers.add(socket.id);
  });
  ```
- This ID represents **one WebSocket connection** (not a URL or IP).
- To send data to a specific user:
  ```js
  io.to(socket.id).emit("update", { message: "DB changed!" });
  ```
- To broadcast to all except sender:
  ```js
  socket.broadcast.emit("userJoined", socket.id);
  ```

On disconnect:
```js
socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  activeUsers.delete(socket.id);
});
```

## 🧠 5️⃣ TCP 3-Way Handshake — Deep Dive

| Step | Sender | Packet Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Client → Server | SYN | Start new connection |
| 2 | Server → Client | SYN-ACK | Acknowledge & sync |
| 3 | Client → Server | ACK | Confirm connection |

Once done → both sides can exchange data reliably.

If HTTPS is used → **TLS handshake** follows for encryption.

---

### 🧠 Visual Sequence

```
Client                Server
  | SYN -------------> |
  | <----------- SYN+ACK |
  | ACK -------------> |
  |--------------------------> HTTP Request / WebSocket Upgrade
```

Then:
- For HTTP → Response & close
- For WebSocket → Keep connection open

## 🔐 6️⃣ HTTPS + WebSocket (WSS) Combined

- WebSockets can also work securely over HTTPS using **WSS (WebSocket Secure)**.
- The order of events:

```
TCP 3-Way Handshake
   ↓
TLS Handshake (Encryption Setup)
   ↓
HTTP Upgrade: websocket
   ↓
Persistent Two-way Connection (WebSocket)
```

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- **TCP handshake** establishes connection reliability.
- **TLS handshake** ensures encryption (for HTTPS/WSS).
- **HTTP** is request/response — one-time communication.
- **WebSocket** (via `Upgrade` header) creates a continuous two-way channel.
- Server identifies clients using **Socket IDs**, not URLs or IPs.
- WebSocket connections stay open until closed manually.

> 💡 **In short:**  
> HTTP = Ask → Reply → Close.  
> WebSocket = Stay connected → Talk freely both ways.
